    /**
     * Input:
     * n = 3
     * arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
     * Output:
     * 1
     * Explanation:
     * If the index returned is 2, then the output printed will be 1. Since arr[2] = 3 is greater than its adjacent elements, and there is no element after it, we can consider it as a peak element. No other index satisfies the same property, so answer will be printed as 0.
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input:
     * n = 7
     * arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1}
     * Output:
     * 1
     * Explanation:
     * In this case there are 5 peak elements with indices as {0,1,3,5,6}. Returning any of them will give you correct answer.
